**Dataset and License**

Dataset sample <a  href="https://github.com/gafniguy/4D-Facial-Avatars/issues/2">available</a>.


**Code Structure**
The nerf code is heavily based on <a  href="https://github.com/krrish94/nerf-pytorch">this repo by Krishna Murthy</a>. Thank you!

Installation etc:
Originally the project used torch 1.7.1, but this should also run with torch 1.9.0 (cuda 11).
If you get any errors related to `torchsearchsorted`, ignore this module and don't bother installing it, and comment out its imports. Its functionality is impmlemented in pytorch.
These two are interchangeable:
```
    #inds = torchsearchsorted.searchsorted(cdf, u, side="right")  # needs compilationo of torchsearchsorted
    inds = torch.searchsorted(cdf.detach(), u, right=True)  # native to pytorch 
```

The main training and testing scripts are `train_transformed_rays.py` and `eval_transformed_rays.py`, respectively.
The training script expects a path to a config file, e.g.:

`python train_transformed_rays.py --config ./config/dave/dave_dvp_lcode_fixed_bg_512_paper_model.yml`

The eval script will also take a path to a model checkpoint and a folder to save the rendered images:

`python eval_transformed_rays.py --config ./config/dave/dave_dvp_lcode_fixed_bg_512_paper_model_teaser.yml --checkpoint /path/to/checkpoint/checkpoint400000.ckpt --savedir ./renders/dave_rendered_frames`

The config file must refer to a dataset to use in `dataset.basedir`. An example dataset has been provided above (see <a  href="https://github.com/gafniguy/4D-Facial-Avatars/issues/2">sample</a>). 

If you have your own video sequence including per frame tracking, you can see how I create the json's for training in the `real_to_nerf.py` file (main function). This does not include the code for tracking, which unfortunately I cannot publish.
